| 6 | MVP Hardening for Low-cost Host | In Progress | 2026-02-23 | - | Codex app-server auth/runtime wired for web + WhatsApp command flow (`/auth connect/status/limits/disconnect`) with OAuth-first chat turns and OpenAI API key fallback. Added restart-safe stale-thread recovery, boot-time auth status visibility in web console, persisted auth telemetry (`lastLogin`/disconnect/status checks) across restarts, richer UI in-flight/status ergonomics with newest-first console option, and first real Baileys live runtime wiring (`/v1/whatsapp/live/status/connect/disconnect`) with inbound token protection/reconnect controls, status-driven QR onboarding, required-prefix + sender-allowlist gating, optional self-message mode for one-number testing, and a guided in-UI WhatsApp setup flow for easier onboarding. Latest updates add direct QR image rendering in `/ui`, a QR generation cap per connect window (manual reconnect required after limit), auto-refresh live status polling so QR/raw payload stay current without manual status clicks, backend-generated QR image payloads to remove CDN dependency, live inbound chat reply relay back to WhatsApp so `/alfred ...` messages receive responses on device, source-level observability cards/change logs in `/ui` for Gateway/Auth/WhatsApp/Memory tracking, a persisted unified interaction stream API/UI feed for cross-channel inbound/outbound/system events, WhatsApp auth-session persistence across gateway restarts by removing implicit logout on runtime stop, real-time SSE stream delivery with polling fallback, persisted WhatsApp-JID to auth-session routing for deterministic OAuth/LLM profile selection, history-sync noise filtering (non-`notify`/stale/duplicate suppression) with accepted-vs-ignored counters in live status to control context bloat, bounded stream retention/noise suppression controls, per-request auth preference selection in `/ui`, explicit no-backend chat guidance, memory-aware prompt injection with source references, persisted-session continuity via transcript view + bounded recent-turn context injection, transcript overflow containment (`pre-wrap` + forced word breaks), fixed transcript max width cap (`800px`), explicit dedicated transcript-frame wrapper, day-scoped transcript filtering (`since`/`until` via date picker, default today) to keep transcript views lightweight, heartbeat reliability controls (persistent heartbeat state, active-hour/idle-queue gating, deduped alerts, heartbeat APIs, `/ui` operator controls, and explicit alerts for auth disconnect, WhatsApp disconnect, and long-running jobs), full `@lid` live chat path compatibility for both inbound parsing and outbound reply relay, consolidated transcript view controls (`All sessions`) with non-overwriting heartbeat form edits during polling, and a new capability-policy baseline (approval-by-default controls, workspace-scoped `/write`, `/web` command path, notes-only write guardrails, env-managed policy flags) now extended with provider-routed web search (`searxng`, `openai`, `brave`, `perplexity`, `brightdata`, `auto`) for `/web --provider=...` execution with SearXNG as default plus optional BrightData comparative path, tokenless yes/no approval resolution for pending actions, explicit pending-approval visibility/resolve paths (`/approval pending`, `/v1/approvals/pending`, `/v1/approvals/resolve`), explicit in-flight progress notifications for long-running `/web` requests, worker-routed long-task execution with progress reporting (`status?` support) and paged `#next` response continuation, planner-first intent routing with confidence-based clarification fallback, balanced approval mode defaults, markdown-driven system-prompt loading for Alfred identity/capabilities/policies, planner-trace stream events (`STREAM_PLANNER_TRACE`) for intent/action observability, locked gateway-as-orchestrator/worker-as-execution architecture decision, durable run-ledger/state-machine tracing (`/v1/runs`, `/v1/runs/:runId`) for per-turn phase visibility, supervisor fan-out parent/child tracking (`/supervisors` APIs + `/supervise web`) with bounded child budgets/timeouts/retries, configurable worker concurrency (`WORKER_CONCURRENCY`), reduced chat-noise progress notifications (throttled intermediate updates with concise running/final messages), and Memory V2 checkpointing/class-aware recall (`/v1/memory/checkpoints/status`, decision/task boundary checkpoints, class-tagged compaction metadata). Remaining: artifact/log retention workers, backup reminders, CI, performance tuning. |

## Recent Task Updates

- 2026-02-27: Extracted stream/run/supervisor/approval routes from `createGatewayApp` into `registerObservabilityRoutes` (`apps/gateway-orchestrator/src/routes/observability_routes.ts`), reducing app-level route clutter while preserving existing API response/validation behavior.
- 2026-02-27: Extracted planner-fallback routing from `GatewayService.handleInbound` into `handlePlannerFallbackRoutes` and fixed async helper returns to `return await` in the `try/finally` flow so run-ledger persistence/finalization remains sequenced and avoids concurrent run-file write races.
- 2026-02-26: Unified orchestrator typing by moving planner/auth preference contracts into shared phase types and reusing them across gateway app + service composition paths to reduce duplicate type maintenance during ongoing refactor.
- 2026-02-26: Refactored UI shell by extracting shared header/navigation rendering into a reusable helper used by `/ui`, `/ui/transcripts`, and `/ui/console`, reducing cross-page duplication while preserving behavior.
- 2026-02-26: Extracted planner-primary routing (`clarify`, `status_query`, `web_research`) into a dedicated helper in gateway service, improving phase separation between planning decisions and downstream route/persist behavior.
- 2026-02-26: Extracted pre-planner directive surface from gateway inbound flow into a dedicated helper covering paging, command execution, implicit approvals, and progress-query responses, keeping planner routing logic cleaner without behavior changes.
- 2026-02-26: Reduced gateway orchestration entrypoint complexity by extracting session-busy and explicit async-job request branches from `handleInbound` into dedicated helpers while preserving queueing and acknowledgement behavior.
- 2026-02-26: Updated architecture docs to explicitly lock conditional hybrid planning (worker can propose, gateway decides/locks execution) and documented WASM sandbox as a deferred post-refactor implementation track.
- 2026-02-26: Refactored worker runtime into execution modules (`createWorkerProcessor`, `createWorkerStatusHandler`) and decoupled RunSpec executor to service interfaces, preserving existing job semantics while clarifying worker lifecycle boundaries.
- 2026-02-26: Refactored gateway inbound entry into explicit normalize/session orchestration phases (`runNormalizePhase`, `runSessionPhase`) so run-ledger start/marker logic is modular and reusable while downstream command/planner routing behavior remains unchanged.
- 2026-02-26: Added hybrid planning contract schemas (`PlanProposal`, `PlanDecision`, `RunSpecLock`) to lock gateway-authoritative run-spec handoff semantics between orchestrator and worker, with dedicated unit tests.
- 2026-02-26: Removed automatic partial `creds.json` reset on Baileys connect after observing a post-scan regression loop where valid transitional auth could be erased and trigger repeated re-registration; runtime now relies on explicit `515` restart recovery without destructive auth-dir mutation.
- 2026-02-26: Added explicit Baileys `stream:error` restart handling for code `515` so gateway now force-recycles socket and reconnects even when Baileys does not emit `connection:"close"`; also expanded disconnect-code parsing (`error.data.attrs.code`) and locked behavior with unit coverage.
- 2026-02-26: Added Baileys interrupted-pairing recovery in runtime startup: when auth creds are partially persisted (`registered=false` but `me/account` present), gateway now backs up stale `creds.json` and forces a clean relink path so WhatsApp does not remain stuck in `connecting` with repeated 428/1006 loop errors and no QR refresh.
- 2026-02-26: Split web UI into dedicated surfaces: `/ui` dashboard for connection/binding controls, `/ui/transcripts` for cross-source transcript viewing, and `/ui/console` for operational stream/testing; console log rendering now caps in-browser history to the latest 500 entries to avoid unbounded growth.
- 2026-02-26: Hardened approval + long-run UX after WhatsApp transcript review: `yes/no` approvals now resolve before planner routing (no accidental clarify loop), balanced mode now requires a single file-write approval for `web_to_file` (send step auto-continues), `web_to_file` uses `auto` provider routing, and RunSpec failures now mark worker jobs as failed instead of succeeded.
- 2026-02-26: Completed RunSpec v1 baseline for long-task orchestration: added schema/contracts, durable run-spec store, generic worker step executor, migrated `web_to_file` to RunSpec steps, added per-step approval checkpoint sequencing, exposed RunSpec details on `/v1/runs/:runId`, and added `/ui` run timeline controls.
- 2026-02-26: Added calendar command flow (`/calendar add|list|cancel`) backed by reminder state, plus workspace-scoped file attachment delivery (`/file send`) over WhatsApp with approval support and `.md/.txt/.doc` guardrails.
- 2026-02-26: Added planner-driven research-to-file orchestration (`web_to_file`) so a natural-language request can trigger search + document synthesis + workspace write + WhatsApp attachment delivery in one worker run, with approval gating for side effects.
